                        <p>In recent years, exterior design has become a vital part of a home&#8217;s identity, with the
                            notion of a comfortable, thoughtfully designed backyard having become a focal point for
                            many. A growing number of people want to essentially live outside instead of staying cooped
                            up indoors! To make the most out of your investment, your outdoor space must offer the same
                            level of well-being and functionality offered by your interior design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Different Areas for Different Purposes</strong></p>
                        <p>Your home benefits from having rooms with distinct atmospheres and functions. Why not give
                            your outdoor space the same consideration by splitting it into different areas that satisfy
                            different needs? When planning your layout, don’t forget to take advantage of the natural
                            elements that are already at your disposal.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Relaxation area</strong>: preferably in a shaded section of the grounds, this
                                area should include comfortable furniture for napping, reading, and chatting. Privacy
                                barriers may be useful to isolate this portion of the yard.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sunny area</strong>: often close to the pool, this area is in the sunniest spot
                                and features loungers for sunbathing. It’s also a perfect area to include exotic plants
                                or playground equipment for kids.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evening area</strong>: the outdoor fireplace is the central focus of this area.
                                Consider elements such as atmospheric ambient lighting, wooden chairs, and music. If
                                you’re keen on keeping away mosquitoes, the use of natural, paving, or river stone is
                                ideal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dining area</strong>: also located in the shade, this area is the most robust
                                part of your layout. It must have enough space to include furniture as well as shelter
                                to protect you from mosquitoes, rain, or harsh sunlight. Your vegetable garden can be
                                placed nearby, and this area ought to be close to the entrance leading inside.</li>
